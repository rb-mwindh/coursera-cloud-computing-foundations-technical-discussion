### 1. Clear elevating goal

For effective teamwork, it is important that the team must have a clear
and easily understood goal that everyone can agree on.
Without a goal, it will be difficult to foster effective teamwork,
as everyone might be pulling in a different direction.

### 2. Results-driven structure

It's key to eliminate politics and personal sensitivities
from the work environment as much as possible.
This can be promoted by a results-oriented environment.

### 3. Competent team members

Having a certain basic level of competency in a team is very important
in order to achieve the goal. People who lack the required competency
might slow down the progress, add to frustration of more competent team
members and might even have a harmful effect on the team or the
goal.

### 4. Unified commitment

For a team, it's important that everyone agrees on the problem to be solved.
Lack of commitment could frustrate your team. This can be very harmful, up to
the complete dissolution of the team.

### 5. Collaborative climate

A collaborative climate requires a supportive mindset from both,
upper management and team members. In a collaborative climate
team members will support an enforce each other, increasing the
team performance through synergies.
In a non-collaborative climate, team performance will decline
because everyone is only concerned with their own success and
may even sabotage their teammates, whom they may consider competition.

### 6. Standards of excellence

The team must have a common understanding about good and bad.
Be it in terms of behaviour, technical solutions, or whatever.
It's similar to the "Clear elevating goal", but instead of
defining the goal, it's about defining the path to reach this goal.

### 7. External support and recognition

The team's efforts and also superior efforts of individual team
members must be recognized from external entities such as upper-level
management (or maybe customers or users or ...). This will
increase the motivation and lead to higher outcome. Lacking
external support and recognition will frustrate the team members
and degrade the performance sooner or later.

### 8. Principal leadership

Anyone who holds a leadership position from the team's perspective
must adhere to high legal and moral standards and be a positive
example for the team. 
Inspirational Leaders are often high on personal integrity.
